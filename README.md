     2. **Main Exam (Mains):** A written exam that includes nine papers, out of which seven are counted for ranking. It tests candidates on various subjects including essay writing, general studies, and optional subjects.
     3. **Personality Test (Interview):** The final stage involves a personal interview to assess the candidateâ€™s personality traits, decision-making skills, and suitability for civil services.
